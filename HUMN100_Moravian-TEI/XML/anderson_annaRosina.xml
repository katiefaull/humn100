               <p> Our dear happily departed sister <placeName>Anna Rosina Anderson</placeName>, has left the following account of herself: I was born the 9th of Aug 1727 at <placeName>Berthelsdorf</placeName>. My Parents belonging to the Cong
                  endeavoured to bring me up in the same connection with the Cong. and send me from my earliest years every Sunday to Herrnhut to the Children’s meeting, which the late Count
                  Zinzendorf kept. He asked me many questions, and tho I did not always understand him, yet it made an impression on my heart and I felt a desire to be happy. When I was in my 7th year
                  my father de- parted happily to our savior, after which the late Count took care of my mother and her children; She came to live in the widow’s house at Herrnhut. </p>

               <p> and her children in the Orphan house, but I for my part had no inclination for it, but chose to stay with my Grand father in Berthelsdorf. After a few years my uncle in Lobenstein
                  desired me to come and live with him, which I was very glad of. I was there above a year, but did not find it so agreeable as I thought, and I prayed many times with tears to the
                  Lord, to help me away again, which he graciously did, For it happened at this time that the late Count came to Ebbersdorf and my uncle had an opportunity to see him; and told him
                  that I was very unhap- py here; on hearing this he took me under his care and sent me to Marienborn to the Orphan house I prayed to the Lord to preserve me here and make me happy,
                  and that I never might come to any <cb />/// any other place except among the Brethren, because I was sometimes enticed by my uncle to go back with him to his home. At that time
                  during a severe sickness which I get, I learned to pray earnestly for my happiness. I found many friends here who wished me well and to see me pros- per for our savior; particularly
                  one sister will always be remembered by me, who, when I had recovered, took me with her into the garden, and kneeling down with me, sent up a fervent prayer in my behalf to our
                  Savior, which I shall never forget. But it was not sufficient to make me happy; because I must feel my savior's comfort and forgiveness for my own heart and this happiness in a very
                  particular manner. Being once quite alone in a place I fell down at his feet and implored his mercy and forgiveness for all my sins through his precious blood.at that time, I felt
                  something, which I cannot express, his comfort to my troub- led soul and his mercy shown to one, </p>

               <p> [illegible] IN the year 1741 I was received into the great girls Choir and in the same year I enjoyed the holy Communion for the first time, which was an unspeakable blessing to my
                  heart. At that time there was a company of great girls which the late Count took par- ticular care of, he kept us Choir meetings and instructed us how to become useful in our
                  Savior's service. I was appoin- ted to keep the Children's and great girls bands , and enjoyed many blessings from our Savior, when we spoke together of his great love and mercy.
                  Soon after I had the office of an assistant among <cb />/// the Children conferred upon me and moved in the same year with this Oeco- nomy to Herrnhaag. All these appoint- ments
                  taught me to come into closer connection with our Savior and showed me that I could do nothing of myself. His mercy and love shown to me bowed me in the dust before him. I had the
                  confidence to cleave to him as a poor sinner, and believed he would help me thro'. 1743 I was accepted an acoluth with a large company, which encouraged me anew to live to him and
                  serve him as a poor Child that has nothing to plead but his mercy from day to day. 1744 I was received into the Single Sisters Choir and 1747 blessed for a Deaconess. 1748 I received
                  a Call to be Single Sister Laboress at Beth- lehem in America. In London February the 10th I was blessed for my office and set out in June. Sept the 20th I arrived in <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName> after
                  a trouble- some voyage. I cannot but take no- that this year the 13th of November was celebrated the first time in </p>

               <p> America, which brought the first impres- sion of that in Herrnhaag 1741 very fresh to my mind, but I was sorry, I could not enjoy in in such a manner as I wished to do. I had to
                  struggle, particularly in the beginning with many difficulties, being young and unexperienced, and had no body to whom I could open my heart and consult with, so as I wished; which
                  made it sometimes <name type="emotion">very heavy to me</name>. But my dear savior helped me through whenever I turned to him in my <name type="emotion">distress</name>. I visited frequently in the most of the country congress which lay
                  very distant from each other. In the year 1755 a war broke out between the French and English, and as the indi- ans generally took share and joined one of the other party, we had
                  very difficult time at Bethlehem and Nazareth. First the settlement of the Brethren at the Mahony about <cb />/// 27 miles from Bethlehem was destroyed by the Indians, where 11
                  Brothers and Sisters lost their lives, after which many mur- ders were committed much nearer, till at last within 6 miles of Bethle- hem. We knew that we were closely watched by the
                  Indians who would gladly have destroyed the place which at that time was the only one capable of making any resistance to their Incursion. The reports of their cruelties at other
                  places kept us in con- tinual alarm and apprehension, particularly as Indians were some- times observed to lurk about and in the place at nights. However the strict watch kept by the
                  Brethren in many parts and particularly about our house but above all the protection of our good Lord, always frustrated their designs. During all these heavy times, our dear Lord
                  was our only comfort and his peace </p>

               <p> was very sensibly felt amongst us. In the year 1762 <persName>Nathanael Seidel</persName> arrived here from Europe, who had lately been married to Anne Joh. Piesch an old acquaintance of mine; from
                  whose conversation and support I received much comfort. In the year 1764 I received a call to return to Europe, Susanna de Gersdorf arrived early in that year to supply my place,
                  and I left Bethle- hem in company with Mr and Mrs Boehler and some other Mr and Mrs in the begin- ning of May. We had a very quick passage, arrived in London the 24th of June; and at
                  Marienborn here the Synod was assembled on the 4th of July. After the Synod was closed I went to Herrnhut and in the year 1765 received a call to serve the choir's in England. I
                  first went to Fulneck, where I stayed about a year, and then got a call to Bedford, where I served the single Srs until the year 1772 when <cb />/// I returned again to Fulneck. To
                  go any further in relating my course I don't think needful. Our savior pas- sion and death and that he has redee- med me poor sinner with his own pre- cious blood, is to me above
                  everything in time and in eternity. He has helped me through this vale of tears and given me grace to place my confidence in him in which I never have been put to shame. When I have
                  the favor to see him face to face I shall kiss his feet with sinner tears for all his mercy bestowed upon me Thus far has this faithful hand- maid of jesus left us an account of
                  herself and of what the lord has done for her soul. There could be much to say of all the periods of grace; where with he has crowned her endeavours and helped her services to so
                  many souls, in devising, comforting and showing them the way to their hap </p>

               <p> [illegible] Her character and the blessing which attended the Labour is known and acknowledged with thankfulness and we heavily wish and pray that we may follow her foot- steps. In
                  the year 1772 when she the second time arrived in Fulneck the choir and economies in Yorkshire were in a very hopeful state and she was received by them with the utmost audacity both
                  of body and mind, deeming it her highest privilege to win souls for christ. The weakened of the flock were always objects of her peculiar care and concern, and she spared no pains
                  what was in tending and bearing them in love; and in such instances when all means <cb />/// proved insufficient, it was evident to all around her, how she always bemoaned their
                  loss. On the other hand our Savior gave her the satisfaction to see many faithful hand- maids, whom she had raised up for the Lord, enter into the different services of his house,
                  which she always looked upon as the greatest favor conferred on herself. As the Choir here in Fulneck considerably in - creased it was in the year 1780 taken into consideration to
                  build a house in Wyke, and the proposal having been approved of, our late sister had the pleasures to assist in laying the foundation stone, which was a blessed solemnity. When it
                  was fur- nished and inhabited by sisters from Fulneck she used to visit them frequent- ly with great faithfulness, and took particular share in their weal and woe; as also in the
                  welfare of the sisters economies at Gummersall, Mirfield and Littlemore; when several years ago the latter was given up, it was a great concern to her mind. </p>

               <p> [illegible] lot of grace and enjoy the blessings and privileges, which were so precious to herself. For us to her own person she regretted exceedingly, that in her latter days old
                  age and weakness prevented her attending every opportunity for dedication and encouragement as much as she wished to do. May the 1st 1802 she was seized with a paralytic stroke, but
                  recovered so far again that she on the 4th of may could attend the meetings <cb />/// in our house. During this winter, her weakness increased and she was much confined to her room.
                  February 15th 1803 she had another stroke, which quite took away the uses of her right side, and, the next day she had strong convulsions so that we all expected her dissolution .
                  She had often expressed a wish for Benade to pray with her at her departure which was now done, and after the prayer the blessing of the Lord was pronoun- ced over her. The feeling
                  of the peace of god on this occasion will leave a deep impression on the minds of all who were present. After the first paroxysm she fell asleep and slumbered for the most part but
                  when she between times awoke she seemed to be sensible, though her speech was so far gone, that she could only say yes or no to the questions asked. The 18th some sisters assembled
                  in her room to sing some verses expressing our fore- taste of that happy cod to be at home </p>
            </div>

               <p> with the Lord; she seemed quite de- lighted with it and kept awake the whole time. The 19th in the afternoon she appeared more collected than before and could speak several words,
                  and when the girls came to see her, she gave them all the hand and said: The Lord bless you. Afterwards she slumbered again till about evening, had a very restless night, and the
                  20th in the morning about 7 o' clock her ? and through the blood of Jesus sanctified soul went gently and happy over into the arms of her beloved bridegroom, during the singing of
                  that verse: When in the arms of Jesus, thy lips shall pallid grow. Her age was 75 years and 6 months. </p>
